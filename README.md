> **⚠️ EDUCATIONAL & RESEARCH PURPOSE ONLY**
This repository contains documentation for a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating a timing vulnerability in Rolling Code implementations. This tool is intended for authorized security auditing and educational research into Sub-GHz protocols.

## 📡 Abstract

Traditionally, the **RollJam** attack (resynchronization attack) requires two simultaneous radio transceivers: one to jam the receiver and another to capture the valid code.

This project demonstrates that a **single CC1101 transceiver** (controlled by the Flipper Zero) can successfully perform this attack by utilizing a highly optimized **Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)** algorithm and bypassing the RTOS scheduler latency.

By implementing **Atomic Interrupts (`__disable_irq`)** during the replay phase, this tool achieves sub-microsecond transmission precision, eliminating the "OS Jitter" that typically causes modern receivers (e.g., VAG, CAME) to reject cloned signals.

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### 1. Sniper Timing Algorithm
Instead of standard jamming, the app utilizes a custom **18ms (TX) / 72ms (RX)** duty cycle. This specific timing is calculated to corrupt the CRC checksum of the target receiver while maximizing the capture window for the Flipper Zero, effectively bypassing the single-chip hardware limitation.

### 2. Atomic Replay Technology
The Flipper Zero runs on FreeRTOS, which introduces unpredictable latency during GPIO toggling. This PoC implements a critical section that disables all hardware interrupts during the signal replay phase.
*   **Result:** A laboratory-grade signal reproduction with **Zero Jitter**, indistinguishable from the original remote control.

### 3. Hardware Integrity Check
The code implements a physical handshake (Write/Read `0x55`) with the external module before starting the attack, preventing BusFaults or Kernel Panics if the module is disconnected.

### 4. Wide-Spectrum Support
Optimized for 24 frequencies, including:
*   **433.92 MHz** (Standard EU)
*   **868.35 MHz** (Secure/Rolling)
*   **433.42 MHz** (Somfy RTS)
*   **315.00 MHz** (US/Legacy)

## ⚙️ Hardware Requirements

*   **Device:** Flipper Zero
*   **Module:** External CC1101 Module (Standard SPI connection)
*   **Firmware:** Tested on Unleashed / RogueMaster (Recommended for full regional unlock).

**Note:** The internal radio is used for signal analysis, while the external module handles the high-power TDM jamming sequence.
